# Mobile-Computing Assignment

Repository for my [Mobile-Computing Laboratory](https://github.com/osaukh/mobile_computing_lab/) assignment in Summer-Term 2021.

An Android app was developed to include classify several activities using the phones Gyroscope and Accelerometer.

This repository contains the [Android App](https://github.com/tlaf0504/mobile_computing_assignment/tree/master/AndroidApp) itself
ass well as the [data-sets](https://github.com/tlaf0504/mobile_computing_assignment/tree/master/Notebooks_Scripts_etc/ActivityRecognition/data)
and all additional [pre- and postprocessing scripts](https://github.com/tlaf0504/mobile_computing_assignment/tree/master/Notebooks_Scripts_etc/ActivityRecognition/notebooks).

Also check out the [report](https://github.com/tlaf0504/mobile_computing_assignment/blob/master/doc/report/conference_101719.pdf) as it contains
the essential ideas and concepts for the developed app in a condensed way.
