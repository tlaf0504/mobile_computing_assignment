\begin{abstract}
    In the \textit{Mobile Computing}-laboratory, at TU Graz, the students
    learn in a hands-on way how to develop application for mobile-devices. 
    As a final result, the students create an Android-Application for either a pre-defined (for beginners)
    or self-chosen (for experienced students) task. 
    As the author had no experience with app-development in advance this course, the pre-defined task was chosen.\newline
    This document describes and discusses the essential ideas and concepts as well as the final performance of the devloped app.
