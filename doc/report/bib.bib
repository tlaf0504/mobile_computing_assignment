	abstract = {Through a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how.By using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python {frameworksScikit}-Learn and {TensorFlowauthor} Aurlien Gron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. Youll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what youve learned, all you need is programming experience to get started.Explore the machine learning landscape, particularly neural {netsUse} Scikit-Learn to track an example machine-learning project end-to-{endExplore} several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble {methodsUse} the {TensorFlow} library to build and train neural {netsDive} into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement {learningLearn} techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets},
